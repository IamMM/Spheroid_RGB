Spheroid RGB Statistic Plugin for ImageJ
========================================

This Plugin is developed for ImageJ or Fiji.

Input:
------
RGB image of double or triple stained confocal image of an cancer spheroid.

---

Output:
-------
Spheroid RGB will take selected Regions of Interest and selected Color
Channels to run over each ROI the following statistics:

- Image:
    - counted cells marked with dots
    - Regions of Interest (ROI) for check
- Table:
    - number of cells of of selected channel and selected ROI
    - mean intensity of each selected color channel and selected ROI
    - ratio between number of cells in percent

ROI | R | G | B
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 300 | 21 | 50
2 | 224 | 70 | 200
3 | 29 | 14 | 42

---

Started from template [minimal Maven project](https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/archive/master.zip) implementing an ImageJ 1.x plugin.


Cell counting based on the algorithm from the [ITCN Plugin](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/itcn.html), which is looking for local intensity peaks in 8-bit images.

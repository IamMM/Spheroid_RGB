Spheroid RGB Statistic Plugin for ImageJ
========================================

This Plugin is developed for ImageJ or Fiji.

Input:
------
RGB image of double or triple stained confocal image of an cancer spheroid.

---

Output:
-------
Spheroid RGB will take selected Regions of Interest and selected Color
Channels to run over each ROI the following statistics:

- Image:
    - counted cells marked with dots
    - Regions of Interest (ROI) for check
- Table:
    - number of cells of of selected channel and selected ROI
    - threshold mean intensity of each selected color channel and selected ROI
    - mean intensity of the peaks which representing the nuclei
    - area measurement of the ROI with calibration from source image
    - ratio between number of cells  and mean values in percent

| ROI | count (red) | mean (red) | mean peak (red) | count (blue) | mean (blue) | mean peak (blue) | area (Î¼m)  | count ratio (%) | mean ratio (%) | mean peak ratio (%) |

- Multi Plot:
    - plot the intensity of multiple profiles through the centroid of the spheroid (selected area)

Started from template [minimal Maven project](https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin/archive/master.zip) implementing an ImageJ 1.x plugin.


Cell counting based on the algorithm from the [ITCN Plugin](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/itcn.html), which is looking for local intensity peaks in 8-bit images.
